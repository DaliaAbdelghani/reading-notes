# Fixed vs Growth mindset Examples

1. **‘I already know all I need to know’** vs **‘I know that there is more than I can learn’** 
*This is a very dangerous line to take. If we aren’t evolving, then we are de-evolving. Don’t for one second think you could possibly know everything there is to know. Did Einstein stop learning about physics in his mid-thirties? That is right, no.*

2. **‘Feedback is criticism** vs **'feedback is an opportunity for me to learn about where I can improve’**
*This can be a slightly more difficult and varied occurrence. Sometimes when feedback is provided, it IS vitriolic or unfair. Other times it is constructive and positive. Often, feedback can be perceived as overly critical or unfair. It is natural to feel defensive about feedback, but it is important to take a step back and try and judge the feedback provided without internal bias. Feedback is there to try to help you develop and improve. Try and reflect on feedback with an open mind and it will help you to develop.* 

3. **‘What’s the point in trying if I’m going to fail’** vs **‘It’s always good to try, failure is a learning curve’**
*How does that old adage go…? ‘If at first you don’t succeed try, try and fail again?’. No, that’s not right. ‘Fail, try and fail again?’. Again, no. ‘try, try and try again’. There we go, got there. Every failure is a learning experience. Failure doesn’t mean you CAN’T do something; it just means you haven’t quite got it right yet.*

4. **‘Why learn new things, there will always be someone who is better at it than me’** vs **‘It is always good to expand my skills repertoire’**
*With this mindset you might as well do nothing and lounge about all day. Now I bet this sounds nice, but we’ve all had that period of seemingly sitting on your couch watching TV for what feels like a week, and we feel awful by the end right? Learn new things and take on new opportunities, you’ll definitely learn something. Who knows, you might end up really enjoying new things.*
