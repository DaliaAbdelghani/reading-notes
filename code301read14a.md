# DB normalization

- **Database normalization** is the process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. 

- Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).

- Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships.

  + 1NF (First Normal Form)
  + 2NF (Second Normal Form)
  + 3NF (Third Normal Form)
  + BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
  + 4NF (Fourth Normal Form)
  + 5NF (Fifth Normal Form)
  + 6NF (Sixth Normal Form)
