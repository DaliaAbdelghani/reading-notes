# CSS

•	CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one heading should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

•	CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

•	CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

•	CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
•	Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
•	There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
•	Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
•	It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
•	CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
•	CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
