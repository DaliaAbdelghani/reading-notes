# CSS Grid

- The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

- A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.

- An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to `grid` or `inline-grid`. All direct children of the grid container automatically become grid items.

- The rows and columns on a grid is defined with the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties.

- Examples of CSS grids available on [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/)
