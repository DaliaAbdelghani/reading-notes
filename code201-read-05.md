# Images in HTML 

+ `<img>` element is sed to add an image into the page. This element is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following attributes:
      + **src** : This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image.

      + **alt** : This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.This text is often referred to as *alt text*.

      + The **title** attribute is also used with the `<img>` element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

      + **height** specifies the height of the image in pixels.

      + **width** specifies the width of the image in pixels.

+ Image placement in HTML page:
 
       1.  before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

       2.  inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

       3.  in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

+ Rules of creating images:

       1. Save images in the right format.

       2. Save images at the right size. 

       3. Use the correct resolution. 

+ Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# Colors and texts in CSS 

+ The color property allows to specify the color of text inside an element. Color in CSS is specified in one of three ways:

      - *rgb values*: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(50,74,90)

      - *hex codes* : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #  sign. For example: #ee3e80

      - *color names*: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

+   It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color.

+  CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

+  CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

+  There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.

+  There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

+  Using a wider range of typefaces is possible by several options, but the right license is needed to use them.

+  It is possible to control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

+  Pseudo-classes can be used to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
