# MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX


## Mustache:

- Mustache is a JavaScript library, which can be referenced from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

- Mustache is a simple web template system. It is described as a logic-less template engine because it does not have any explicit control flow statements, such as if and else conditionals or for loops. Looping and conditional evaluation can be achieved using section tags processing lists and lambdas.

- The Mustache templates support is built into many web application frameworks. The support in JavaScript includes both client-side programming with many JavaScript libraries and Ajax frameworks such as jQuery, Dojo and YUI, as well as server-side JavaScript using Node.js and CommonJS.

- Mustache. js provides a well documented template system which can be used to manage the templates. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object

- For using Mustache.js, a script tag is added to the html file pointing to mustache.js which is available on CDN.

## Flexbox:

- The Flexbox Layout aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).

- Felexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).

- Flexbox is used to create a row or a column axis layout. It makes it easier to design and build responsive web pages without having to use a lot of float and position properties in the CSS code.
