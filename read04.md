+ **JavaScript** makes webpages more interactive by:
1.	ACCESS CONTENT
2.	MODIFY CONTENT
3.	PROGRAM RULES
4.	REACT TO EVENTS 

+ A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

+ How to write a script:
    1. DEFINE THE GOAL
    2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
    3. CODE EACH STEP  
 

+ **EXPRESSIONS**: An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. 

+ **Types of expressions**:
•	EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
•	EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.  

+ Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
   1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
   2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
   3. STRING OPERATORS
   4. COMPARISON OPERATORS
   5. LOGICAL OPERATORS

+ **ARITHMETIC OPERATORS**

+ **STRING OPERATORS**
    There is just one string operator: the + symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

+ **Basic JavaScript Instructions**:
  -	A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
  -	Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
  -	Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
  -	Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
  -	JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
  -	Expressions evaluate into a single value.
  -	Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
