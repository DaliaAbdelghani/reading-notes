- The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are `action` and `method`.

- The `action` attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.
