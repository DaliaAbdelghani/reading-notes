# Lists in HTML:

HTML provides three different types of lists:

+ ***Ordered lists***: lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

+ ***Unordered lists*** : lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

+ ***Definition lists** : made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

+ Nested lists: a second list can be put inside an `<li>` element to create a sub-list or nested list.Browsers display nested lists
indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.

# Boxes in HTML:

+ Every box in HTML page has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
  - Border
  - Padding
  - Margin

+ CSS is used to control the dimensions, borders, margin and padding for each box.

+ It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.

+ Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

+ Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.

+ CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# Basic JS Instructions:

+ Arrays: is a special type of variable stores a list of values, these values are accessed as if they are in a numbered list, the
numbering of this list starts at zero. 

+ Creating array in JS:

+ Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

+ Comparison operators '(===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)' are used to compare two operands.

+ Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

+ `if ... else` statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

+ `switch` statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).

+ Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

+ All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

+ There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
