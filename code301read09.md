# Functional Programming

- Functional programming : is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

-  Functional programming: is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles. Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.

- The core concepts of practical functional programming are:

   + Pure functions. 
   + Function composition.
   + Avoid shared state.
   + Avoid mutating state.
   + Avoid side effects. 

- Functional programming favors:

  + Pure functions instead of shared state & side effects.
  + Immutability over mutable data.
  + Function composition over imperative flow control.
  + Lots of generic, reusable utilities that use higher order functions to act on many data types instead of methods that only operate on their colocated data.
  + Declarative rather than imperative code (what to do, rather than how to do it).
  + Expressions over statements.
  + Containers & higher order functions over ad-hoc polymorphism.

  # Refactoring Javascript for Readability

  - Refactoring is a type of changing code without changing the behavior of the code. 

  - Tips for Refactoring Javascript code:

    + Use a script loader.
    + Namespaces. 
    + Use Modules, classes and jQuery.
    + Custom controls.
    + Wrap the console.
