# ***HTML Links:***

+ Links : Allow the user to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

+ Links types are:
  - Links from one website to another .
  - Links from one page to another on the same website.
  - Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page.
  - Links that open in a new browser window. 
  - Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone. 

+ Links are created using anchor tag `<a>...</a>`.

+ Email link syntax in HTML: `<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>`.

+ To link a page within the same site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

+ The id attribute is used to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

# ***CSS Layouts:***

+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

 + If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

 + `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

 + Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

 + The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

 + Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

 + Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

 + Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

 + CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

 + It is possible to include multiple CSS files in one page.

 # ***JS Functions, Methods, and Objects:***

 + JavaScript functions are defined with the `function` keyword.

 + Functions are declared with the syntax: `function functionName(parameters) { // code to be executed }`

 + Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

 + A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression.

 + Functions allow to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

 + Functions can take parameters ( informatiorn required to do their job) and may return a value.

# ***Pair programming:***

+ Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together, it involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 

+ The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

+ The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.

+ Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

+ Advantages of pair programming:
   1. Greater efficiency.
   2. Engaged collaboration.
   3. Learning from fellow students.
   4. Social skills.
   5. Job interview readiness.
   6. Work environment readiness.
