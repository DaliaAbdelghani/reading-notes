 #Audio, Video, Images in HTML

-  `<img>` tag is used to add images in HTML.

- The `src` property is used to indicate the address of the image to be added.

- The size of an image is controlled using the `width` and `height` properties in CSS.

- It is preferable to unify the images sizes in HTML for smoothly downloading of the pages.

- Rather than using `width` and `height` attributes; the sizes are given names (such as small, medium and large) as values for the class attribute.

- There are two ways to align images : 

   1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image. 

   2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

- Images are inline elements. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block-level element using the `display` property with a value of `block`. Then to horizontally center an image:

   1.  On the containing element, the text-align property with a value of center is used.

   2.  On the image itself, the margin property and setting the values of the left and right margins to auto is used.

- `background-image: url("image address")` is used to set an image as a background for the page or other elements.

- The `background-repeat` property can have four values: repeat, repeat x, repeat y and no repeat. 

- Rollover : creating a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it.

- Sprite: using single image for several different parts of an interface.

- Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help the site appear nearer the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics that the website covers.

-  Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.

- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.

- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.

- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

- The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages.

- `HTMLMediaElement` is used to control video and audio players programmatically â€” for example: `HTMLMediaElement.play(), HTMLMediaElement.pause()`.
