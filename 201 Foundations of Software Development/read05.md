# Comparison and logical operators

## Comparison operators:

+ Less than (<) — returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
+ Greater than (>) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
+ Less than or equal to (<=) — returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
+ Greater than or equal to (>=) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
+ Equal to (===) — returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
+ Not equal to (!==) — returns true if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

# LOOPS 

*The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.*

There are four types of loops in JavaScript.

1.for loop: iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iterations is known.

2.while loop: iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iterations is not known.

3.do-while loop: iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false.

4.for-in loop: iterate the properties of an object.
