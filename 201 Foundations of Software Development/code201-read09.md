# HTML Forms

- An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

- The HTML `<form>` element is used to create an HTML form for user input.

- The `<form>` element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.


- The HTML `<input>` element is the most used form element.

- An `<input>` element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the `type` attribute.

- The `<input type="text">` defines a single-line input field for text input.

- The `<label>` tag defines a label for many form elements.

- The `<label>` element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

- The `<input type="radio">` defines a radio button. Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.

- The `<input type="checkbox">` defines a checkbox. Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.

- The `<input type="submit">` defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler. The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.

# HTML Tables

- HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

- The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table.

- Each table row is defined with a `<tr>` tag. Each table header is defined with a `<th>` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a `<td>` tag.

# HTML Lists
 - HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

 - An unordered list starts with the `<ul>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag.

 - An ordered list starts with the `<ol>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag.

 - A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

 - The `<dl>` tag defines the description list, the `<dt>` tag defines the term (name), and the `<dd>` tag describes each term

# JS Events

 - HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

 - When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

 - An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. For examples:
    + An HTML web page has finished loading
    + An HTML input field was changed
    + An HTML button was clicked

 - Common HTML events : onchange, onclick, onmouseover, onmouseout,  onkeydown, onload.
