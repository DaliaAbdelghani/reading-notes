* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
