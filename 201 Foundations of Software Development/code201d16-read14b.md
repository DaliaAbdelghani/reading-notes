- Google found in her quest to build a perfect team that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough.

- Over a decade, Google was measuring the aspect of its employees’ lives in order to build teams based on peoples characters to achieve best work results, such putting introverts together or putting friends in one group. 

- Googles concluded in their project Aristotle that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

- One of the researches concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

- The searches favored the the free-flowing Team over the serious-minded Team.

- Google’s searches have led it to the conclusion that in the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
