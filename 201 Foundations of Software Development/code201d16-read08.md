# More CSS Layout

'display' is CSS's most important property for controlling layout. Every element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default for most elements is usually 'block' or 'inline'. A block element is often called a block-level element. An inline element is always just called an inline element.

**Inline** elements will squeeze next to each other on one line (and wrap if they have to, just like words in a sentence). A 'span', a 'button', and an 'img' are all inline elements, according to default browser styling.

**Block elements**, on the other hand, like to stand alone. In terms of printed console output, you could think of a block element as having a '\n' newline before and after it. Itâ€™s like a 'console.log("\ndiv\n")'. The 'article', 'div', 'li', 'ul', and 'p' tags are block-level elements.

 '<div>' elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

 Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative,  absolute, or fixed positioning.

The 'float' property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)


 Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
